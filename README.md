<h1>BMI Calculator in Flutter</h1>
    <p>
      This is a simple BMI calculator app built using Flutter. It allows users to
      input their weight and height, and then calculates their BMI and displays
      the result along with a color-coded indicator of their weight status
      (underweight, normal, overweight, or obese).
